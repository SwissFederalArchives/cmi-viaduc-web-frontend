/**
 * #### The central entry point that allows to configure an initialize the Unblu Visitor JS API.
 * The static Unblu API works without actually loading the rest of Unblu.
 * It can do some general checks and load unblu or connect the API to a loaded version of Unblu.
 * The JS API is an optional add-on to the Unblu visitor site integration.
 *
 * Depending on how unblu is integrated into the local website the API has to be initialized differently.
 *
 * **a.) API-only integration**
 * If no unblu-snippet is loaded into the page, unblu can be fully initialized with the API.
 * In this case, both the `configure` and the `initialize` methods have to be called.
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 *  const api = await unblu.api
 *      // configure the unblu server
 *      .configure({
 *          apiKey: "<your-api-key>",
 *          serverUrl: "<unblu-server-url>"
 *      })
 *      // initialize the api.
 *      .initialize();
 * ```
 * This implementation will load the Unblu snippet and initialize both unblu and the JS API.
 *
 * **b.) Snippet and JS API integration**
 * If the Unblu snippet is already present in the local website, unblu doesn't have to be loaded
 * and only the API has to be initialized.
 * Example:
 * ```ts
 * // directly initialize the api without configuring.
 * const api = await unblu.api.initialize();
 *
 * ```
