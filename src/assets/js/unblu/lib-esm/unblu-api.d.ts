 *
 * The API connects to the integrated version of Unblu. All actions performed via the UnbluApi are executed in
 * the name of and with the rights of current visitor and may have direct effect on the displayed Unblu UI.
 *
 * For example if a conversation is started from the UnbluApi, the unblu UI will navigate to it.
 * If a conversation is closed via the API, it will also be closed on the Unblu UI of the visitor.
 * For more information on UI side effects please check the documentation for each method call.
 *
 * For programmatic administrator access and configuration of Unblu please use the Unblu WebAPI.
